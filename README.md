# dice-roller
This is a simple RNG meant to be used in place of dice for D&amp;D. It is meant to be neither impressive nor complicated. I am new to coding, and this is my first attempt at making a simple JavaScript app and using Git and Github in general.

**Planned Functionality:**
- Record previous rolls
- Option to roll multiple dice at one time
